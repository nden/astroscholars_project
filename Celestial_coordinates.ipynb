    "A useful construct for describing locations of objects in the sky is the celestial sphere, which is considered to have an infinite radius. The center of the earth is the center of the celestial sphere, and the sphere's pole and equatorial plane are coincident with those of the earth. We can specify precise location of objects on the celestial sphere by giving the celestial equivalent of their latitudes and longitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point on the celestial sphere directly overhead for an observer is the zenith. An imaginary arc passing through the celestial poles and through the zenith is called the observer's meridian. The nadir is the direction opposite the zenith: for example, straight down from a spacecraft to the center of the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important feature intersecting the celestial sphere is the **ecliptic** plane. This is the plane in which the Earth orbits the sun, 23.4° from the celestial equator. The great circle marking the intersection of the ecliptic plane on the celestial sphere is where the sun and planets appear to travel, and it's where the Sun and Moon converge during their eclipses (hence the name).\n"

    "\n",
    "**Right ascension** `RA` is the celestial equivalent of longitude. RA can be expressed in degrees, but it is more common to specify it in hours, minutes, and seconds of time: the sky appears to turn 360° in 24 hours, or 15° in one hour. So an hour of RA equals 15° of sky rotation.\n",

    "The zero point for `RA` is one of the points where the ecliptic circle intersects the celestial equator circle. It's defined to be the point where the sun crosses into the northern hemisphere beginning spring: the **vernal equinox**, also known as the first point of Aries, often identified by the symbol of the ram.\n",
